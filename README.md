# PennLabsChallenge

Welcome to my implementation of the PennLabs server challenge! This implementation contains the required features along with the base of a login page (It is not complete, but I also included a route that seeks to register new users by creating a new instance of user object with its id and password (hashed with passlib) stored in the instance. Different users will be stored in a global list in index.py. The User.py file that implements the user object, with methods that store the user's ranked club list according to an arbitrary score assigned by the user. I also included an html/css draft of the login page which came from online templates.

## Instructions
1. Clone the file and run python.py
2. Copy and paste the url shown in terminal
3. Access the different routes through adding in the extensions in the browser.
